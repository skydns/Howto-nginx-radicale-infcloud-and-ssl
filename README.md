Help for configuration nginx with radicale and infcloud

I searched long for a tutorial, how to configure nginx, radicale and infcloud. While radicale setup is very simple, the configuration of infcloud won't be if you don't know what to do.

This is not a step by step tutorial, but the mayor code where changes have to be made you will find here.

The configuration that works fine with me, may be it's altough a solution for you. You find it in the wiki on top
